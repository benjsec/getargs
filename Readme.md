# getargs

This is a clone of http://pauahtun.org/Software/getargs.html which I'm hosting
as a way of adding a `setup.py` file and allowing it to be installed with pip.

Some legacy projects rely in this package, and having it hosted here makes
installing it easier during any transition period.

I am not intending to provide long-term support for this and advise against
using it in any new projects!
